## Project
- Always use `yarn` as our package manager.
- There is JS part in `src` and Rust part in `src-tauri`.
- To test changes in src run `yarn build`
- To test changes in src-tauri run `yarn tauri build`

## Version management
- Always try to use exact version of packages, don't use `^` or `~`.
